Application Name – “My Medicine Cabinet” : Connecting you to the FDA!  

Goal – Allow users to interact with the FDA about their prescriptions in a fun and interactive manner. Users will enter the drugs they take and get feedback from the FDA on all information they have from their open APIs.  In reverse, users will be able to enter information related to their adverse effects or issues related to the drugs they are taking, providing data back to the FDA.  Here the FDA could be performing analysis on this crowdsourced data and get ahead of issues early.
